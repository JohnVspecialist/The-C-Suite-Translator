Are you struggling to communicate technical information that drives decision-making effectively to executives/decision-makers?



I created this prompt to solve the common problem of technical teams struggling to communicate effectively with executives.



Use Cases:

ML Model Performance Reports - Translating accuracy metrics into business value



Security Incident Briefings - Communicating threats without technical jargon


Project Status Updates - Highlighting critical path items for resource allocation



ROI Analysis - Connecting technical investments to business outcomes



Risk Assessments - Conveying technical vulnerabilities in business terms





Test Examples:
